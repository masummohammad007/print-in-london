                <p>2012: London is hosting the summer Olympics, the <br /> first Avengers film is released, and Route 1 Print is born.Back then, <br /> we only had two members of staff and we were manually processing every order that came <br /> through our eBay store. We were the budding new brand from Bluetree Design & Print but we <br /> grew fast.We made good use of the group’s 20 plus years’ experience in the print <br /> industry and now, <br /> only a few years down the line, we’re the largest <br /> online trade printer in the UK!</p>
